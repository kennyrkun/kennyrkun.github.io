i love to create things. most of my projects are just me making my own versions of things people have already made. i do this just so that i can have the perfect experience. you'll find a lot of it is star trek based.

my best work:
- [bobwars](http://github.com/kennyrkun/bobwars)  
- [SFUI](http://github.com/kennyrkun/sfui)  
- [SFLCARS](http://github.com/kennyrkun/SFLCARS)  
- [kunlauncher](http://kunlauncher.000webhostapp.com)  

i have experience in multiple programming languages, but I'm most proficient in C++:  
- PHP - since 2014  
- C++ - since 2016  
- Java - since 2018  
- C# - since 2019
