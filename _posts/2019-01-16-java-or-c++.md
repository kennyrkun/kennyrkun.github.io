title: java or c++
---

i'm really conflicted.

# c++
c++ was my first real programming language. before i finally figured out how to use c++, i was trying to use lua, for garry's mod. i never really got lua, and i'm still not able to use it anymore than printing something to the console.

but when i started using c++, i got the hang of it almost instantly. i don't know why. everything just came to me, and no other language has ever done that before.

until now.

# java
i started using java recently in order to make custom plugins for my minecraft server.
