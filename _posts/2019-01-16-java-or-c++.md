title: java or c++
---

i'm really conflicted.

# c++
c++ was my first real programming language. before i finally figured out how to use c++, i was trying to use lua, for garry's mod. i never really got lua, and i'm still not able to use it anymore than printing something to the console.

but when i started using c++, i got the hang of it almost instantly. i don't know why. everything just came to me, and no other language has ever done that before.

until now.

# java
i started using java recently in order to make custom plugins for my minecraft server. in the beginning, i really didn't know what i was doing. that was until a few months ago, when i needed to actually make a useful plugin. there's where Erostey was born, and it wasn't really even meant to do a lot. i just wanted teleport effects like an enderman. that grew into multiple custom species though, and much more. after about a week, i got the hang of it. i can't really say i know Java, though, because I don't. I know the Spigot/Bukkit API. if I were to try to  make real a Java application from scratch, I would have no idea what i'm doing. the only reason i can use it for plugin development is because it doesn't use a lot of Java's specific features. most of what I know comes from C++, and most of the sematics are the same. only a few things like final/static and everything being in a class are new to me.
