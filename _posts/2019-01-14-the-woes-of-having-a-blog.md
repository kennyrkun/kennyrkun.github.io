title: the woes of having a blog
---

i've always liked reading technical blogs. things that explained how people did things, or why they did things. i always thought maybe i coudl do one of those myself if i do something worthwhile. well, i think i have and i'm going to start using this as a blog for the Erostey plugin/server.
 
the main reason i wanted to do this because of factorio's [friday fun facts](https://www.factorio.com/blog/). i thought it was really neat and could be useful for the players. the idea is to give them a behind the scenes sort of look at Erostey. i'll explain how things work on the technical side, like why ViriPlaga's armour makes me want to off myself. i'll also explain our reasoning on things, like nerfs or buffs. the aim of thise is engange players more and make them feel involved.

still though, i don't even know if this'll work out. honestly, i'm not a great writer, and i don't know if i'll be able to consistently write engaging articles on the state of this dinky little server that's constantly broken. i think i've tried a few times in the past, but, i could just never find anything interesting to write about. maybe that's my problem, i don't think anything is interesting enough. perhaps i'll just write everything, if just to improve my writing skills.

i guess we'll just have to see how this goes.
